Part 1

Note for Part C: In sphere.vs I have written three possible solutions for part c (Lines 99, 100, 101). 2 of which are commented out. Option 1 has a heart that throbs with respect to time, this is my favourite output but maybe doesnt count as a "deformation". Option 2 (uncommented) transforms the original sphere to the heart, this is a nice conceptually but looks quite ugly. Option 3 is a generic sphere to ellipsoid transformation in case the other ones don't satisfy the "deformation" question specification.
Keybinds:

W: Orb moves forwards.
